## üß† Calculator Logic

Two accepted logic types:

* **Immediate Execution** (e.g., 3 + 5 √ó 6 = evaluates left to right).
* **Formula/Expression Logic** (respects operator precedence: √ó and √∑ before + and -).

This calculator uses **\[state your approach here]** logic and handles expressions accurately using JavaScript‚Äôs built-in `eval()` or a manual parser.
